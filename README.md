# SNEK (IN PROGRESS)

Snek is a lightweight local database which allows the user to store json data locally. Snek is meant to be readable, easy to use, and somewhat quick. A lot of inspiration comes from [TinyDB](https://github.com/msiemens/tinydb), this project would not be possible without learning from TinyDB. Snek was not developed to be used as database for a fortune 500 company or to hold every facebook account, instead it was developed for use in middle and small scale projects. My idea behind creating this was to create a small database that could be used without a big setup or fuss and also still be usefull to what I need it for. I like the idea of using something I created for projects. Another driving principle is learning from a tool. Feel free to use and improve.

### TODOS

* [ ] Get read/write cache working (Working on this)
* [ ] Implement query cache, queries can be slow

### Documentation will be coming soon
