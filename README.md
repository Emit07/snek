# SNEK

### STILL IN PROGRESS

snekDB is a lightweight local database which allows the user to store json data locally. Snek is meant to be readable, easy to use, and quick. Feel free to use and improve. I will update the README soon but I need to do some other work on the script.

## Features and TODOs
